following a harrowing depletion in recent decades earths protective ozone layer high in the planets atmosphere is on the track to recovery according to a new report released at the united nations headquarters in new york the evaluation conducted by scientists credits much of this recovery to international action that phased out the production and use of ozone depleting chemicals since the last comprehensive ozone assessment the use of most of these harmful substances has continued to drop and the ozone may be on the path to recovery according to the new report there are telltale signs of ozone recovery in the upper part of the stratosphere said a national oceanic and atmospheric association emeritus scientist the ozone layer located in earth stratosphere miles above the ground shields the planet from much of the sun damaging ultraviolet radiation researchers realized that gases such as chlorofluorocarbons and halons which were commonly used in appliances such as refrigerators spray cans insulation foam and fire suppressants led to the depletion of the ozone layer noaa researchers said the scientific community found a seasonal ozone hole over antarctica and spurred action to prevent its growth almost two hundred countries joined together to ratify the montreal protocol which is designed to phase out ozone depleting substances noaa researchers said there are positive indications that the ozone layer is on track to recovery towards the middle of the century achim steiner said in a statement the montreal protocol one of the world most successful environmental treaties has protected the stratospheric ozone layer and avoided enhanced uv radiation reaching the earths surface if the montreal protocol had not passed the use of ozone depleting substances could have increased tenfold unep officials said instead the protocol will have prevented an estimated two million cases of skin cancer annually and will continue to protect wildlife and agriculture according to the unep the new report also highlights the intricate links between the ozone layers recovery and climate change ravishankara said for instance some chemicals that have replaced ozone depleting substances are still potent greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming to fight back scientists from noaa earth system research laboratory are testing potential substances that are safe for the ozone layer climate and environment experts said if countries continue to abide by the montreal protocol ozone levels across the globe are expected to recover to previous concentrations but the hole over the south pole likely wont heal ravishankara said researchers affiliated with the unep and the world meteorological organization plan to keep a close eye on ozone levels in the years to come michel jarraud said in a statement human activities will continue to change the composition of the atmosphere jarraud said wmo global atmosphere watch program will continue its crucial monitoring research and assessment activities to provide scientific data needed to understand and ultimately predict environmental changes as it has done for the past twenty five years researchers will present the report dubbed the scientific assessment of ozone depletion in november at the annual meeting of the parties to the montreal protocol the full report which is expected to inform policymakers will be published early next year
